# BestForkURJC

Project Name: Mysite
-----AppName: Prueba

This project is a web application. The main objective is to analyze Github repositories with
Python code. The web aplication retrieves information about its forks and calculates the score
depending on the code quality. Then it retuns a list of the forks of the repository sorted by this
rating. The main objetives are: Help developers to choose the best fork to begin some project;
if it is your own repository, you can know if other developers are doing a good job and, by last,
it serves as an argument for a pull request.
For this project, we have used the last technologies on the server side, like as: Django,
Python, API de GitHub, Pylint y SQLite3,and for the client side, like as: HTML5, JavaScript,
CSS3 y Bootstrap.
This project arises from the need to make an application that leverages the features of GitHub.
